# Machine Learning Architecture Recreations

This repository is a compilation of machine learning architectures that I have recreated. 
Many of these architectures are based on those listed in different published papers - 
in each of these cases, the README.md in the associated model folder should contain a link to the paper that the architecture is taken from.

When I am first working on a recreation task, I often will recreate the model in its own repository - looking across my profile you may find some of these.
After I have successfully (or come close enough), I then refactor the code to follow the formatting used across this repo and add it here.
